## How it Works ?
   A typing speed tester is like a virtual coach for user keyboard skills. It gives you passages to type and measures how fast and accurately user can type them. As user type, it keeps track of user's speed in words per minute and may highlight any mistakes user make. It's like a friendly guide that encourages you to type better by providing feedback. With different texts and challenges, it's a way to sharpen your typing skills and become a faster, more accurate typist.
